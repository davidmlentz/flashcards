# Flashcards

This app aims to build knowledge useful for the AWS SA Pro exam.

`chmod +x` the flashcards.sh script, then start it with `./flashcards.sh`. It'll ask you a question. It won't evaluate your answer. Type your response if you want. Hit enter to see the answer. Repeat.

These questions come from notes I've taken on AWS SA Pro courses from acloud.guru and udemy. In turn, these often reference AWS content such as FAQs. Generally I've tried to include only questions that ask about either course material or material which the courses have indicated is useful for the exam. It's not intended to just include lots of info about AWS. It's intended to build knowledge required to pass the test.

Some of the questions are somewhat obvious (particularly some T or F) but I think are still helpful reminders of, for example, some of the capabilities of various AWS services.
