426 A: T. It can. It can also do in-place upgrades if your targets are 1) EC2 instances or 2) an ASG. But if you're using CodeDeploy with an ASG, you can also do blue/green. (It creates a 2nd ASG and brings up the new version there. Requires an ALB.)

427 Q: T or F: CodeDeploy can deploy to autoscaling groups.
427 A: T.

428 Q: T or F: CodeDeploy can deploy to Lambda.
428 A: T. It creates a new Lambda version then uses traffic shifting to move traffic to the new version.

In fact SAM uses CodeDeploy natively.

429 Q: T or F: CodeDeploy can deploy to ECS.

456 A: Server Migration Service. Useful for rehosting applications. AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) is an agentless service which makes it easier and faster for you to migrate thousands of on-premises workloads to AWS. AWS SMS allows you to automate, schedule, and track incremental replications of live server volumes, making it easier for you to coordinate large-scale server migrations. Migrate entire VMs, but only VMware Vsphere, Windows Hyper-V, and Azure VM.

472 A: Trusted Advisor. It's enabled at a basic level (core checks) by default for all customers, but has an advanced version available for enterprise and business customers (full set of checks and allows you programmatic access to the API). Among other things, it gives recommendations for cost optimization and points out service limits.

473 A: T. But it can't let you know if an object within a bucket is public.

474 Q: T or F: AWS Trusted Advisor can let you know if an object in an S3 bucket is public.
474 A: F. But it can let you know if the bucket is public.
