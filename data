607 A: VMWare, Azure, Hyper-V

608 Q: T or F: SMS is agentless.
608 A: T. CloudEndure requires an agent, though.

The intention is to provide enough capacity to maintain utilization at the target value specified by the scaling strategy." from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/plans/userguide/how-it-works.html

636 Q: "____ scaling uses machine learning to analyze each resource's historical workload and regularly forecasts the future load for the next two days."
636 A: Predictive. "Predictive scaling generates scheduled scaling actions to make sure that the resource capacity is available before your application needs it.

651 Q: T or F: EFS has multiple storage classes.
651 A: T. Standard and Infrequent Access. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/storage-classes.html

652 Q: What are the 2 throughput modes EFS uses?

"Using the default Bursting Throughput mode, throughput scales as your file system grows. Using Provisioned Throughput mode, you can specify the throughput of your file system independent of the amount of data stored." See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html.

657 Q: T or F: You can mount an EFS file system using either the DNS name or the IP address of a mount target.
657 A: T. It'll have the same DNS name in all availability zones, but a different IP. So mounting using the IP is probably higher maintenance. "A mount target provides an IP address for an NFSv4 endpoint at which you can mount an Amazon EFS file system. You mount your file system using its Domain Name Service (DNS) name, which resolves to the IP address of the EFS mount target in the same Availability Zone as your EC2 instance." See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html BUT if you're mounting the filesystem from an on-prem host, you should use the IP address an  NOT the hostname: "For the sake of simplicity, we recommend mounting an Amazon EFS file system on an on-premises server using a mount target IP address instead of a DNS name." ibid

658 Q: How many mount targets can an EFS file system have in an availability zone?
658 A: 1.

659 Q: T or F: An Amazon EFS file system can only have mount targets in one VPC at a time.

662 Q: T or F: You can configure EFS to automatically move stale data to the IA storage class.
662 A: T. "Amazon EFS lifecycle management automatically manages cost-effective file storage for your file systems. When enabled, lifecycle management migrates files that haven't been accessed for a set period of time to the Infrequent Access (IA) storage class. You define that period of time by using a lifecycle policy." https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/how-it-works.html

663 Q: What are the 2 EFS performance modes?
663 A: General Purpose and Max I/O

673 A: VGW.

674 Q: re: CloudFormation...use the ____ attribute when you want to wait on resource configuration actions before stack creation proceeds.
674 A: CreationPolicy. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-creationpolicy.html Compare this to wait conditions: "For Amazon EC2 and Auto Scaling resources, we recommend that you use a CreationPolicy attribute instead of wait conditions." ... and wait conditions are best for coordinating the creation of stack resources with configuration actions external to the stack. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-waitcondition.html
